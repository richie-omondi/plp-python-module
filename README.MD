# PLP SD Scholarship Python Projects

This folder contains various Python projects completed as part of the PLP Software Development (SD) Scholarship program. Each project demonstrates different Python programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## Projects

- **intro-to-python.py**: A simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) based on user input.
- **built-in-data-structures.py**: Demonstrates basic list operations in Python, including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of an element.
- **control-flows-and-functions.py**: Contains a function to calculate the final price after applying a discount. Prompts the user for the original price and discount percentage, applies the discount if it is 20% or higher, and prints the final price.
- **file-and-exception-handling.py**: Reads a file, writes a modified version to a new file, and demonstrates error handling for file operations (e.g., file not found or unreadable).
